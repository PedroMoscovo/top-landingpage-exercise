# top-landingpage-exercise

This is my attempt on completing the Landing Page exercise from The Odin Project.

Did not add any custom images or text as I wanted to recreate exactly like the example given sice it would make me practice border radius and creating boxes with divs.

Tried centering all the content using a container but could not get it to work so I just stuck with the information learned throughout the course. Will come back to update this so it works with a container.

Fun project after all the exercises done before and made me google some extra knowledge which was great!
